# 📜 Learn

Although not a detailed guide, here's some stuff to help you kick off your project.

## ☁️ [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)

This is the domain management system used to point nameservers and site URLs. Here's an example [migration guide](https://youtu.be/XQKkb84EjNQ).

## 🌊 [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com)

This is the hosting platform used. If you're setting up continuous deployment (CD), the [App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform) service is the easiest route to avoid manually configuring your infrastructure. Here's an example [setup guide](https://youtu.be/0xsPqOi_XpM) for deploying a Flask app with [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/), a popular Python production-level web server.

## 🌶️ [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/)

This is the Python web framework used. For a very minimal setup, use the [quickstart guide](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/quickstart/). There are many alternatives and counterparts to this framework that have their own pros/cons.

## 🟣 [Deta](https://www.deta.sh/)

This is the database/storage service this app uses. Constantly fetching fresh information through raw operations is not necessary/viable. Fetching and storing this data on startup or timed loops ensures a reasonable response time. Here's some [docs](https://deta.space/docs/en/build/fundamentals/data-storage).

## 🎒 [GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

You can set up such an app at no cost with the amount of resources offered by the student pack. You can register domains up to a year with promotions from services like Namecheap. There are cloud services such as DigitalOcean and Azure to choose from for your web server. You can opt for complexity with MongoDB and a plethora of other resources in exchange for proof of student enrollment.
