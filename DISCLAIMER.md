## Food and Nutrition
All `food` endpoints are retrieved on a daily basis with the exception of `items` and `locations`. All nutritional items are retrieved for the latest information upon every request. All university managed locations will present the latest [Waitz](https://waitz.io/) (real-time busyness) information upon every request.

The following excerpt is from the university's [nutrition page](https://nutrition.sa.ucsc.edu/): "Due to the dynamic nature of the current situation, menus may change without notice. We will keep the online menu as up-to-date as possible, however, you may find item substitutions in the dining halls that are not reflected online. We will continue to indicate the top 8 allergens on the menu cards at individual stations, and ask that customers with other food allergies or dietary concerns speak directly to a Unit Manager. For general nutrition questions, please email our [Dining Nutrition Specialist](mailto:bvanotte@ucsc.edu). Thank you for your understanding."
